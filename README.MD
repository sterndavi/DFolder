# Vectorized functions for creation, ziping and deleting files over folders

A collection of small utility functions used to create folders, zip those folders contents and delete those same files, all while using the same vector as relative path.

These functions were extensively used in a specific task that involved transforming, exporting and sending lot of attachments via E-Mail. Transfomed it into a package to keep my scripts as simple as possible.

installing with remotes: `remotes::install_github("sterndavi/DFolder")`
